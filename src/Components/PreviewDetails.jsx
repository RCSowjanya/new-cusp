                <h2 className="font-bold my-2">2. User Responsibilities:</h2>
                <p>
                  <strong>• Accurate Information Submission: </strong> When
                  submitting their solar panel installation requirements, Users
                  must provide accurate, complete, and detailed information.
                  This includes specifications, site conditions, and any other
                  relevant details to ensure that the quotes received are as
                  precise as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>• Timely Decision-Making: </strong> Upon receiving a
                  quote from an installer or OEM, the user is required to
                  communicate their decision—whether to accept, reject, or
                  negotiate—within 24 hours. Prompt decision-making helps
                  maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of the platform.

                  responsible for maintaining timely and clear communication
                  with the selected installer throughout the project. This
                  includes coordinating site visits, providing necessary access,
                  and responding to any queries from the installer to avoid
                  delays.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>• Acknowledge Quote Variability: </strong> The User
                  acknowledges that the initial quotes provided through the CUSP
                  platform are based on the preliminary information User has
                  submitted. These quotes are tentative and may be subject to
                  change upon further evaluation by the SPI/OEM. User is
                  responsible for negotiating the final price directly with the
                  SPI, taking into account any adjustments or additional
                  requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>• Due Diligence: </strong> Users should conduct their
                  own due diligence before finalizing any agreement with SPI or
                  OEM. This includes verifying credentials, reviewing past work,
                  and ensuring that all terms of the contract are clearly
                  understood and agreed upon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>• Compliance with Laws and Regulations: </strong> User
                  must ensure that their project complies with all local laws,
                  regulations, and permitting requirements. It is the User’s
                  responsibility to secure any necessary permits or approvals
                  prior to the commencement of installation.
                </p>

                  between the end-user and the installer will be governed by the

                  <strong>• Platform Functionality: </strong> CUSP provides a
                  platform to connect end-users with SPIs and/or OEMs. While we
                  strive to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
                  information and services provided, CUSP is not liable for any
                  errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the quotes, services, or

                  agreements entered with these third parties are solely between
                  the User and SPIs and/or OEMs, and CUSP is not liable for any
                  disputes, claims, or damages arising from these agreements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>• Variability of Quotes: </strong> User understands
                  that the initial quotes provided through the CUSP platform are

                  upon further assessment by the SPI and/or OEM. CUSP is not
                  responsible for any discrepancies between the initial quotes
                  and the final agreed-upon price.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>• Convenience Fee: </strong> In cases where CUSP
                  charges a convenience fee, this fee is solely for the use of
                  the platform and does not imply any liability on the part of
                  CUSP for the services provided by third parties. The liability
                  of CUSP for any claims related to the convenience fee shall be
                  limited to the amount of the fee paid by the User.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>• Service Availability: </strong> CUSP reserves the
                  right to limit or discontinue its services at its sole
                  discretion, without notice. CUSP is not liable for any loss,
                  delay, or inconvenience caused by the unavailability or
                  disruption of services.
                </p>

                  <strong>• Indirect or Consequential Damages: </strong> Under
                  no circumstances shall CUSP be liable for any indirect,
                  incidental, special, or consequential damages, including but
                  not limited to loss of profits, loss of business interruption,
                  or loss of data, arising out of or in connection with the use
                  of the platform or the services provided by SPIs and OEMs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>• Total Liability: </strong> In all cases, the total
                  liability of CUSP, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise,
                  shall not exceed the total amount of any fees paid by the user

                <p>
                  <strong>• Automatic Termination: </strong> The agreement
                  between the User and CUSP automatically terminates upon the
                  expiry of the quote validity period or upon the User’s final
                  decision regarding the quotes obtained through CUSP, whether
                  it be acceptance, rejection, or negotiation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>• Termination by CUSP: </strong> CUSP reserves the
                  right to terminate the service at any time if the User
                  violates any of the terms and conditions outlined by CUSP or
                  engages in fraudulent, deceptive, or illegal activities. Such
                  termination may occur without prior notice, and CUSP shall not
                  be liable for any consequences arising from the termination.
